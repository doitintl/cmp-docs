# Change Billing Currency

If you need to change your company's Billing Currency, a new Billing Profile must be registered using the Cloud Management Platform. The currency of existing billing profiles cannot be changed.

From the main dashboard, locate the three-dots icon on the right-hand side of the page and click 'New Billing Profile'.

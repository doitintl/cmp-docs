# Exchange rates

When DoiT International charges in local currency, we convert prices pursuant to the conversion rates published by leading financial institutions. Like many other large companies, we are using https://fixer.io to obtain historical currency exchange rates.

{% hint style="info" %}
We will not notify you for increases in non-USD prices that are due to currency conversion fluctuations.
